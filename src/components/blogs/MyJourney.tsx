      <p>
        My fascination with computers began at an early age when I received my
        first computer, complete with a bulky CRT monitor. The moment I switched
        it on, a whole new world of possibilities opened up before me. I eagerly
        explored every nook and cranny of that machine, from the simple yet
        mesmerizing world of Microsoft Paint to the various pre-installed games
        and utilities.

      <h3>The Spark in School</h3>
      <p>
        My interest in computers only grew stronger with my school&apos;s computer
        classes. The structured learning provided a solid foundation and
        introduced me to the basics of HTML. At the age of 12, armed with this
        newfound knowledge, I created my first website. It was a school
        portfolio website, utilizing the information I found in my school diary.
        The sense of accomplishment and the joy of seeing something I built live
        on the internet was exhilarating.
      </p>
      <h3>Academic Pursuits</h3>
      <p>
        Determined to turn my passion into a career, I decided to pursue formal
        education in computer science. I completed my bachelor&apos;s degree in
        Computer Applications, which deepened my understanding of various
        computer technologies and programming languages. This was followed by a
        Master&apos;s in Computer Applications, where I further honed my skills and
        expanded my knowledge base.
      </p>
      <h3>Diving into Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        During my studies, I discovered a particular interest in web
        development. The idea of creating interactive and dynamic websites that
        could reach millions of people fascinated me. I began learning frontend
        development with React.js, which led to an internship at Mithya Labs.
        This hands-on experience was invaluable, allowing me to apply my
        theoretical knowledge to real-world projects.
      </p>
      <h3>Mastering the MERN Stack</h3>
      <p>
        Eager to broaden my skillset, I delved into the MERN stack (MongoDB,
        Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This comprehensive understanding of both
        frontend and backend development landed me a full-time position at
        Azympto. At Azympto, I worked on a video streaming platform using the
        MERN stack for both the website and the app (React Native). These
        challenging projects significantly enhanced my problem-solving and
        coding skills.
      </p>
      <h3>Co-Founding Netnimbus</h3>
      <p>
        While working at Azympto, the entrepreneurial bug bit me. I co-founded a
        startup called Netnimbus, a company specializing in website and app
        development, design (graphics, UI/UX, logos, etc.), and algotrading. The
        experience of building a company from the ground up was immensely
        rewarding and educational. It taught me not just technical skills but
        also business acumen, teamwork, and resilience.
      </p>
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        As I continue my journey in the tech world, I remain passionate and
        curious about new technologies and innovations. My early fascination
        with computers has grown into a fulfilling career. Looking ahead, I am
        excited to move to the US to pursue a Master of Science in Computer
        Science at CSU Sacramento. I look forward to the new opportunities and
        challenges this next chapter will bring.
